/**
 * Transition view rendered while the host is tearing the iframe
 * session down (user clicked "End session" / power-off).
 *
 * 1-to-1 port of
 * `reachy_mini_mobile_app/src/ui/screens/session/LeavingView.tsx`
 * — the desktop host and the mobile shell deliberately share the
 * exact same disconnection visual so a user moving between the
 * two clients sees a consistent "Putting Reachy to sleep…" beat.
 *
 * Visual posture
 * ──────────────
 * Mirrors `<ConnectingView>`'s anatomy (stack centred on the
 * vertical axis, primary visual on top, title below) so the
 * leave-screen reads as the symmetric counterpart of the join-
 * screen. But where Connecting carries a 3-dot stepper + bold
 * headline + a two-line caption to narrate a multi-phase
 * bring-up, Leaving is intentionally one beat lighter:
 *
 *   - a small, low-contrast spinner instead of the stepper
 *     (the user already decided to leave - we don't need to
 *     dramatise the wait),
 *   - a single short headline, no caption (the goto-sleep
 *     trajectory is short enough that a sub-line of explanation
 *     reads as filler by the time it lands).
 *
 * The trailing ellipsis on the headline is enough of a
 * "something's still happening" cue without needing a second line
 * of copy.
