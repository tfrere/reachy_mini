"""Cross-thread concurrency lock for the robot's **managed app slot**.

Despite its position in the daemon, this lock does **not** block every
code path that can drive the robot — SDK clients talking to the daemon
directly over LAN/WebSocket bypass it entirely. What it serializes are
the two *managed* entry points where "an app has the robot":

- Local Python apps launched by :class:`AppManager` (main asyncio loop).
- Remote WebRTC clients handled by the central signaling relay (in the
  relay's dedicated thread + event loop).

Without coordination these two paths can run simultaneously and fight
over motors/media. This lock is the single source of truth for which
managed app currently owns the slot.

States are mutually exclusive:

- ``free``: no managed app holds the slot.
- ``local_app(name)``: a Python app is running.
- ``remote_session(name)``: a remote client is connected via central.

Transitions are triggered by:

- ``AppManager.start_app`` / app exit  → local_app / free
- Relay receives ``startSession`` / ``endSession`` / disconnect → remote_session / free

A local-app acquire evicts any remote session in progress: the remote
peer is notified via ``endSession`` so it can tear down cleanly, and the
relay stops accepting new remote sessions until the local app exits.
A remote-session acquire is refused outright if a local app is running.
